# PDF Outline Extraction Approach

## Overview

This project extracts outlines from PDFs by finding the title and headings (H1, H2, H3) with their page numbers. It works with different PDF styles and processes documents quickly.

## Technical Approach

### 1. PDF Parsing

I used PyMuPDF to extract text from PDFs:

- Get text with its properties (font, size, bold/italic, position)
- Clean up text to handle weird characters
- Organize everything by page

### 2. Heading Detection

To find headings, I look at several clues:

- **Patterns**: Things like "Chapter 1" or "1.1 Introduction"
- **Font Properties**: Bigger text or bold/italic text
- **Position**: Text at the top of pages
- **Keywords**: Words that often appear in headings

### 3. Heading Classification

To sort headings into levels (H1, H2, H3):

- Group similar font sizes together
- Look at numbering (1, 1.1, 1.1.1)
- Check which text is bolder or bigger
- See how headings follow each other and their indentation

### 4. Title Extraction

To find the document title:

- Check the first few pages
- Find the biggest, most noticeable text
- Use some tricks to tell titles from headers or logos
- Ignore page numbers and other non-title stuff

### 5. Making It Fast

To process PDFs quickly (under 10 seconds for 50 pages):

- Prepare search patterns ahead of time
- Use faster ways to handle text
- Stop looking for the title once found
- Be smart about memory usage
- Process one page at a time

## Libraries Used

- **PyMuPDF**: For reading PDFs
- **NumPy**: For math stuff
- **scikit-learn**: For grouping similar things
- **pandas**: For organizing data

## Problems I Solved

- **Different PDF styles**: Used multiple clues instead of just font size
- **Speed issues**: Made the code faster without losing accuracy
- **Different languages**: Made sure it works with non-English text
- **Weird document layouts**: Created flexible pattern matching

## Future Ideas

- Add machine learning to better identify headings
- Handle more complex documents
- Make it work better with more languages
- Add support for scanned PDFs
